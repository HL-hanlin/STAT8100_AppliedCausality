This is the official code from the paper [Causal Confusion In Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11979.pdf), which only contains the code for the simple toy environment of mountain car. 

We contain the code here for completeness, since it is the starting point of our project. 

Our code implementation for the project is more complecated, which is based on the atari games environments, and is located under /src directory.
