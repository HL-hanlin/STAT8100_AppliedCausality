# Progress

## Week 1, Jan 23 - Jan 30: 

Created this repo!

Finished the assigned reading: [Causal Inference In Statistics: A Primer](https://www.datascienceassn.org/sites/default/files/CAUSAL%20INFERENCE%20IN%20STATISTICS.pdf). 

Detailed [reading notes](https://www.datascienceassn.org/sites/default/files/CAUSAL%20INFERENCE%20IN%20STATISTICS.pdf) is under /doc folder of this repo.


## Week 2, Jan 31 - Feb 6:

Start thinking about project topics. 

I took IEOR 4575 Reinforcement Learning from Prof. Shipra, as well as COMS 6998 Bandits & Reinforcement Learning from [Prof. Krishnamurthy](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~akshay/) this semester, so I'm very willing to do some projects at the intersection of causal inference and reinforcement learning!

The [Causal Reinforcement Learning (CRL)](https://crl.causalai.net/) website is quite useful, since it summarizes recent advances of CRL according to several tasks pretty systematically. 


## Week 3, Feb 7 - Feb 13:
