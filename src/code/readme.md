This repo contains code we tested on Atari Games. We tested another variant of VAEs -- VQ-VAE, and also its variant VQ-VAE2, whcih could lead to non-trivial improvement compared with the beta-VAE used in the paper [Causal Confusion in Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11979.pdf) we referenced in our final report.

But since our main focus is not on VAEs, we decide not to include results from this code into our final report.
